<h3>About</h3>
<p>This Task Phrase Extraction web application extracts task phrases from natural language sentences. 
Task phrases are conceptualized as verbs associated with a direct object and/or a prepositional phrase, 
such as "get iterator", "get iterator for collection", or "add to collection". To extract task phrases, the application makes use of 
grammatical dependencies between words, as detected by the 
<a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/" target="_blank">Stanford NLP parser</a>. 
While the algorithm was originally developed for software documentation and includes 
features specific to software-related texts 
(e.g., detection of code elements and a built-in list of programming actions), 
it is applicable outside of the software domain as well.<br><br></p>
<p>This project is a collaboration between the <a href="http://ctreude.ca/" target="_blank">
Software Engineering Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/" target="_blank">
University of Adelaide</a> and the <a href="http://cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/" target="_blank">
Software Technology Group</a> at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">
McGill University</a>. The underlying "algorithms for automatically extracting descriptions of programming tasks from software documentations" 
have been registered as invention #16068 at McGill University on October 16, 2015.<br><br></p>
